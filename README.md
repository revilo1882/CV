I am a junior developer and recent graduate from Makers Academy, a highly selective intensive 12 week software bootcamp with a focus on test driven development, object oriented programming and XP values.

I have over ten years experience in the Financial Services industry as a fund administrator and accountant and am looking to utilise my problem solving and analytical skills to take my career in a new direction.  I am a fast learner looking forward to a new challenge that allows me to apply my recently acquired skills and continue building my knowledge to help me gain experience in the tech industry.

#### Problem Solver

Problem solving is in my nature and is the main reason I was drawn to a career as a software engineer.   Throughout my professional career I have constantly looked for ways to improve and automate processes.  This has included building Excel macros to improve the speed and accuracy of daily tasks and updating financial statement templates to meet any new accounting standard requirements.  I also enjoy keeping my brain active in my spare time with any new puzzles I can find for my phone.

#### Quick Learner

I was accepted onto the Makers Academy course after just one month of looking at code for the first time having quickly recognised my aptitude and enthusiasm for the subject.  During the course I have learned three new languages and various frameworks while also learning about all the best practices in software development.  During my time in the financial services I achieved recognition from my peers and management for my analytical and mathematical skills and moved from a fund administrator to fund accountant role with little formal training and quickly became the sole producer of the financial statements of one of the most highly recognised property funds in the UK.  

#### Attention to detail

An important aspect of my role as both fund administrator and accountant was constant attention to detail.  Daily and monthly results were sent to the client or released to the stock exchange and any errors could result in a financial impact to the company.  Excellent results were achieved whilst under intense pressure to meet tight deadlines.  I have found this skill has really helped me so far in debugging code or preventing bugs in the first place and is also something I find very rewarding.
