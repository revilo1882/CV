## Oliver Harris

A full stack Ruby developer in training, looking to become a junior software development at the end the highly selective Makers Academy intensive 12 week intensive software bootcamp.

I am an experienced fund administrator and accountant looking to use my problem solving and analytical skills to take my career down in a new direction.  A quick learner who works well using own initiative while demonstrating the organisation and prioritisation required with adherence to achieve tight deadlines, quality, and accuracy.  Enjoys working as part of a successful and productive team, and thrives in highly pressured and challenging working environment.

## Skills

#### Problem Solver

Throughout my professional career I have been constantly looked at ways to improve processes and automate them if possible.  This has included building excel macros for daily processes and … .  I also enjoy keeping my brain active in my spare time with puzzles, usually playing on an app on my daily commute or before going to bed.

#### Quick Learner

Took on the bridge from fund administrator to fund accountant without much formal training and quickly became the sole producer of the financial statements in the company of one of the most highly recognised property funds in the country.  I was accepted onto the Makers Academy course after just one month of looking at code for the first time in any real detail.

#### Attention to detail

An important aspect my my roles both fund administration and accountant was constant attention to detail.  Daily or monthly results were sent to the client or released onto the stock exchange and any errors could result in a fine to the company.  High results were achieved whilst under intense pressure to meet tight deadlines.
