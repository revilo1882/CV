I am a junior developer and recent graduate from Maker Academy a highly selective  intensive 12 week software bootcamp with a focus on test driven development, object orientated programming and XP values.

I have over ten years experience in the Financial Services industry as a fund administrator and accountant and am looking to utilise my problem solving and analytical skills to take my career in a new direction.  I am a fast learner looking forward to a new challenge to apply my recently acquired skills and continue building on that knowledge to help me gain experience in the industry.

#### Problem Solver

Throughout my professional career I have constantly looked for ways to improve and automate processes them where possible.  This has included building excel macros to improve the speed and accuracy of daily tasks and updating financial statement templates to meet any new accounting standard requirements.  I also enjoy keeping my brain active in my spare time with puzzles, usually playing on an app on my daily commute or before going to bed.

#### Quick Learner

I achieved recognition from my peers and management for my analytical and mathematical skills and moved from a fund administrator to fund accountant role with little formal training and quickly became the sole producer of the financial statements of one of the most highly recognised property funds in the UK.  I was accepted onto the Makers Academy course after just one month of looking at code for the first time in any real detail having quickly recognised my aptitude and enthusiasm for the subject.

#### Attention to detail

An important aspect of my role as both fund administrator and accountant was constant attention to detail.  Daily and monthly results were sent to the client or released to the stock exchange and any errors could result in a financial impact to the company.  Excellent results were achieved whilst under intense pressure to meet tight deadlines.
