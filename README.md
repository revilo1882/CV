I am a junior developer and recent graduate from Makers Academy, a highly selective intensive 12 week software bootcamp with a focus on test driven development, object oriented programming and XP values.  My love for technology and problem solving has led me to the world of coding and I haven't looked back since.

I have over ten years experience in the Financial Services industry as a fund administrator and accountant and am looking to utilise my analytical skills to take my career in a new direction.  I am a fast learner looking forward to a new challenge that allows me to apply my recently acquired skills and continue building my knowledge to help me gain experience in the tech industry.

#### Clean code and TDD advocate

I am an advocate for clean, DRY, readable, and adaptable code. I have learned that in the long run, this approach lowers the risk of mistakes having wide spread effect, and allows new features to be added with ease without breaking current tests.

I believe that a TDD approach is integral to good software development. At makers, I have found that compliance to the ways of TDD have massively improved my ability to write efficient code, debug and gain visibility when faced with blockers.

#### Problem Solver

Problem solving is in my nature and is the main reason I was drawn to a career as a software engineer.   Throughout my professional career I have constantly looked for ways to improve and automate processes.  Coding has felt like a natural fit for me as I see it is an endless set of problems while finding ways to automate whatever I can.  I particularly love finding a bug in code and going through steps to gain visibility in order to solve the problem.

#### Quick Learner

I was accepted onto the Makers Academy course after just one month of looking at code for the first time having quickly recognised my aptitude and enthusiasm for the subject.  During the course I have learned three new languages and various frameworks while also learning about all the best practices in software development.  During my time in the financial services I achieved recognition from my peers and management for my analytical and mathematical skills and moved from a fund administrator to fund accountant role with little formal training and quickly became the sole producer of the financial statements of one of the most highly recognised property funds in the UK.  

#### Teamwork

I have always found that a happy team is a productive team which can maintain the ability to work through the highs and the lows.  During my career, in order to achieve this and be part of a successful team I worked on developing my communication, decision making and planning.

During my time at Makers I was able to develop my skills further firstly by being introduced to through pair programming and XP values and later through software development in small teams of 4 to 6 people using agile methodologies such as sprints and Kanban.

#### Attention to detail

I pride myself on my work being of a high standard and error free as can be.  This was an important aspect of my role as both fund administrator and accountant as daily and monthly results were sent to the client or released to the stock exchange and any errors could result in a financial impact to the company.  Excellent results were achieved whilst under intense pressure to meet tight deadlines.

I have found this skill has really helped me debugging code and creating clean code and is also something I find very rewarding.
